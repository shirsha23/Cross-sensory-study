After running 'SIMULATION' for this condition (by default simulation is running for vis-vis), 
this folder will contain:

1) Simulated data in regular order and in reverse order (when betas for prior_stimulus1 and prior_stimulus3
   are switched.
2) Recovered beta coefficients for when simulated in regular order and for when simulated in reverse order.
3) Plots (supplementary figures 2 and 3) - for each subplot in these figures a different plot is produced here.
