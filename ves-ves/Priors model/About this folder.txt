After running 'MAIN', this folder will contain two results files of the model fitting:

1) ModelResults_avg3priors+RMS - model M3 (in which 3 prior stimuli are averaged) results for each participant. 
   This includes all four beta coefficients and AIC and BIC for each model.
2) ModelResults_3priors+RMS - model M3E (in which 3 prior stimuli are separated) results for each participant. 
   This includes all six beta coefficients and AIC and BIC for each model.
